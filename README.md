# ðŸ““ Noteshelf
A place to store and share your jupyter notebooks
![Preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kerbaras/noteshelf/main/docs/preview.png)

## Motivation
This project was born out of a necessity to share and colab on jupyter notebooks. It's goal is to combine certain toolsets provided by other solutions like notion.so, redash, tableau and google drive but in a data-sience-focuse. 

In the world of data it's common that not all stackholders are interested to see the entire code and when you colaborate in a sufficiently large team it's hard to keep track of your notebooks without paied solutions. 

Noteshelf not only should be able to help visualizing your experiments and reports but also help you build it.

## Ecosystem
- [![In Progress](https://img.shields.io/badge/-in%20progres-red.svg)] A react frontend capable of rendering notebooks
- [![Todo](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Todo-gray.svg)] A JupyterHub orchestrator to serve as a runner for your kernels
- [![Todo](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Todo-gray.svg)] A Proxy between the land of Jupyter and Noteshelf (auth, share, colab, publish)
- [![Todo](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Todo-gray.svg)] A Helm Chart definition for self-hosting
